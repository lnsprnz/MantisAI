# Dataset Characteristics

## Dataset Overview

In our project, we used black and white images from high-speed video recordings of a praying mantis, hunting. The animals were placed orthogonally to the camera, with a prey item (fly) on the left hand side. First, the mantis will approach the prey item and then initiate the predatory strike. During the strike, the animal is rapidly extending its forelegs to get its tibia behind the prey, to lock it between femur and tibia (Figure 1). In this first trial, we are analizing only images of one species.

All recordings were taking with 4000 frames per second and all images are initially in 1024x1024 in size. Usually, one video of a predatory strike has 1000-2000 images, that are relevant to characterize the motion of the predatory strike. We used 220 images from different videos, showing the mantis in different postures during the striking sequence.
