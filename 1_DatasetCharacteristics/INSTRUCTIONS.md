# Dataset Characteristics

## Overview

In this milestone, you are required to explore and analyze the dataset you are using for your project. Understanding your dataset is a critical component of any machine learning project.  
Utilize statistical graphics, plots, and information tables to summarize the dataset's main characteristics.

## Guidelines

Provide information on the following issues:

- **Dataset Overview**
- High-speed videos in tif format (1024x1024). Large areas can be cropped to reduce size. One video consists of ~1000 images. 4 moving structures are to be defined and the associated pivot points between them to be determined.

- **Missing Values**
- Camera hat aussetzer (Ameisenbild).

- **Feature Distributions**
- 

- **Possible Biases**
- 

- **Correlations**

Follow the instructions provided in brackets in the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) in this folder.

## Submission

Complete the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) to conduct your analysis of the dataset characteristics.
