  - **Objective**:  
The primary goal of this paper is to explore and compare state-of-the-art architectures for human pose estimation through keypoint detection using TensorFlow. The research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different models like DeepPose, HRNet, and OpenPose for detecting body joints in humans, focusing on their performance across multiple datasets.

  - **Methods**:  
    - **Models**:  
      - **DeepPose**: A regression-based approach using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to estimate key body joints.
       - **HRNet**: Maintains high-resolution representations throughout the network for superior pose estimation accuracy.
       - **OpenPose**: A bottom-up architecture that detects all body joints in an image and groups them into individuals.
  
    - **Dataset**:  
      - Utilizes the COCO and MPII datasets, which provide annotated keypoints for human pose detection.  
     - Preprocessing includes cleaning and structuring annotations into accessible formats using libraries like mmPose and CocoDataset.

    - **Evaluation Metrics**:  
      - **PDJ (Percentage of Detected Joints)**: Measures the percentage of keypoints detected within a threshold distance.
      - **OKS (Object Keypoint Similarity)**: Combines distance, scale, and keypoint-specific thresholds for evaluation.
      - **mAP (Mean Average Precision)**: Averages precision across all keypoints and datasets.

    - **Implementation**:  
      - Conducted experiments using mmPose for DeepPose and HRNet implementations and TensorFlow for OpenPose.  
      - Evaluations were performed on the entire datasets, and visual inference was used to demonstrate real-world performance.

  - **Outcomes**:  
    - HRNet consistently demonstrated the highest accuracy across all metrics, especially on large body joints like shoulders, with slight struggles on smaller joints like ankles.  
    - DeepPose and OpenPose provided faster inference times but with reduced precision compared to HRNet.  
    - The architectures showed varying performance, with HRNet achieving the best balance of speed and accuracy, followed by DeepPose and OpenPose.  
    - The results emphasize HRNet's superiority in maintaining spatial resolution and the need for optimization in detecting smaller body joints.
